		Since its beginning in the late 60’s, the <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#internet2" TARGET="glossary">Internet</A> has grown. It includes many
		applications such as file transfer, electronic mail and terminal access.
		<BR>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#tcpip" TARGET="glossary">TCP/IP</A> Protocol suite matured in an environment nurtured by academic research
		and government support. When it starts, only a few team adopted the protocols
		and connected their network together. 
		<BR>
		TCP/IP shows its capabilities, thus more and more organisations have plugged
		their network into the world’s largest and fastest growing network : the
		Internet. Today, Internet is the amount of thousands of networks and it reaches
		dozens of country.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Many new applications and utilities have been developed by many managers and
		users of the Internet. Also, a lot of people started to depend on the Internet
		in their usual work. The need of a merging for all the management protocols
		became urgent in order to have an assurance of availability, satisfactory
		performance and rapid solutions to the problems. 
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		As TCP/IP became widely used in private commercial enterprise network, it
		requires more features. Commercial enterprise can’t afford to have long network
		outages and long host downtimes. They are also concerned by the security and
		the confidentiality. So the Internet community has to responded to these
		demands. 
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		A common network management toolset was required for the TCP/IP and the
		Internet. The starting point was then given by the <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#iab" TARGET="glossary">IAB</A> and his <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rfc" TARGET="glossary">RFC</A> 1052 in
		1988.
