		The devices in the network contain information about themselves (like
		parameters and statistics). Devices have current status that indicates if the
		running conditions are healthy and many interesting knowing about its
		neighbourhood (active stations, statistics, problems).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		This information are the heart of Simple Network Management. The key elements
		are the following :
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		What piece of information is interesting ?
		<BR>
		<UL>
			The interesting information have been conscripted. So, it leads to a
			standardisation of the form and meaning of information stored across many
			different vendors products.
		</UL>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		How to name it ?
		<BR>
		<UL>
			You need the name of an item to ask for it. So, the management framework include
			a well-defined way to assign names.
		</UL>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		How to get it or change it ?
		<BR>
		<UL>
			<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#snmp" TARGET="glossary">SNMP</A>
			has become the nick for the entire Simple Network Management framework,
			but SNMP refers only to a part of the framework that gets information from
			device and changes the values (of the configuration parameters).

		What kind of configuration, status and statistical information are associated
		with a device ?
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Any network node has one or more interface to media.
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Network interface has a defined configuration type (e.g. Ethernet,
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#x25" TARGET="glossary">X.25</A>
		, and
		so on).
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Interface have an operational status of Up, Down and Testing.
		<BR>
		<LI>
		A system normally counts
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#interf" TARGET="glossary">interface</A>
		statistics (e.g. number of send and receive
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#frame" TARGET="glossary">frames</A>
		...)
		<BR>
		<BR>
		In the beginning,
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#snmp" TARGET="glossary">SNMP</A>
		, was created to manage
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#tcpip" TARGET="glossary">TCP/IP</A>
		networks. Thus information
		a bout
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#ip" TARGET="glossary">IP</A>
		and
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#tcp" TARGET="glossary">TCP</A>
		received the earlier notice. Then later, information was
		described far the activities of other protocols (such as DC Net, AppleTalk,
		IPX/SPX,), and every function of the multi-protocol
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#router" TARGET="glossary">Routers</A>

		nowadays need to be managed.

		<BR>
		
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			MIBs
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The information may be stored at device as a combination of switchs, settings,
		hardware counters, in memory variables and tables or files. This can be
		considered conveniently as a database.
		<BR>
		
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#snmp" TARGET="glossary">SNMP</A>
		standards, use this logical database of network management information. It
		is called a
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A>
		(Management Information Base). The internal structure of those
		MIBs are not important for the manager, but the way and the accessibility of the
		data base is very important.

		The agent receive messages and send a
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rep" TARGET="glossary">response</A>
		back. Agent does not have to wait
		for order to act, if a serious problem arises or a significant
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#event" TARGET="glossary">event</A>

		These application are not standardised. Management station vendors compete
		vigorously in providing the best interface ( graphical, intuitive information
		display, application, the best toolkit for adding specialised application...).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		What do those application do ? (here is a few examples)
		<BR>
		<LI>
		They map the tested LAN (What and which type of device are there, other
		station)
		<LI>
		Render graphs of the traffic report
		<LI>
		Managers can select its own parameters ( e.g. : significant event, spontaneous
		problems report, message from other applications)
		<BR>
		<BR>

			Structure and Identification of Management Information
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Each device contains a database of information that it would be useful to know
		about. This database is called MIB.
		<LI>
		SNMP define a simple set of messages that let us read and write database
		variables, and receive trap reports of problem events.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<UL>
			But there is still the questions :
			<BR>
			How to define and describe MIB variables, how are different variables related
			to one another, how to identify a variable that we want to read or write, and
			how should the variables be represented ?
		</UL>
		
		The answers are given in the RFC 1155 Structure and Identification of
		Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets. This RFC follows the ISO /
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#ccitt" TARGET="glossary">CCIT</A>
		lead in dealing with the four following issues :
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<LI>
		MIB variables are defined and described using the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#asn1" TARGET="glossary">ASN.1</A>
		(Abstract Syntax
		Notation 1) datatype definition language. It allow to create data structures,
		like in other languages such as Pascal or C, plus a few additional capabilities
		to go beyond the possibilities of other languages.
		<LI>
		Network management information has been incorporated into a large tree
		administered by
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#iso" TARGET="glossary">ISO</A>
		and
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#ccitt" TARGET="glossary">CCITT</A>
		(the tree structure helps us to visualise the
		relationship between variables).
		<LI>
		The Identifiers for the Network Management are issued from the tree. The name
		of a parameter is a sequence of number along the path from the root of the tree.
		<LI>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#ber" TARGET="glossary">Basic Encoding Rules</A>
		(BER) are used for translations of value of ASN.1
		variables into a fixed transmission format. Data will always be formatted in
		the same way (between managers and agents). Then the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#agent" TARGET="glossary">agent</A>
		and the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#manager" TARGET="glossary">manager</A>
		translate in its own native language.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The SNM framework is very modular. It is has been a good choice motivated by
		the desire to do ease later migration to ISO management standards.
		<BR>
		Modularity adds new branch to the management information  trees without any
		changes of protocol.
		<BR>
		The protocol is based on Read, Write and
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#event" TARGET="glossary">Event</A>
		messages thus if we want to
		perform an action we just define the variable that causes the action when it is
		set to 1. A new action is just a new variable in the MIB.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Thus enormous expansions are possible without any change on the protocol.

			Structure of the Managed Objects
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The management community use the OBJECT term instead of variable. An
		object has the following specificities : a name, attributes and a set of
		operation
		that can be performed on the object.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#snmp" TARGET="glossary">SNMP</A>
		describe managed objects that hold the Network information. A
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A>
		is a set
		of managed objects.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		A managed object is viewed as :
		<BR>
		<LI>
		a unique name,
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#oi" TARGET="glossary">OBJECT IDENTIFIER</A>
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Attributes
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- datatype
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- description (including details required to
		build the correct implementation)
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- status information.
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Valid operations that can be performed on the object (read, write, set)
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		VARIABLES :
		<BR>
		Stored at a device is an individual instance of managed object. A variable have
		to be implemented so that it conforms to its MIB object definition.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		The formal template used to define MIB is the following one (here is the example
		of sysDescr in RCF 1213)
		<BR>
<PRE>
sysDescr OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX DisplayString (SIZE (0.255))
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		„Textual description of the entity.
		This value include the full name and
               the version identification of the system’s
		hardware type, software operating-system
		and networking software. It may only
		contain ASCII printable characters "
	::= { system 1 }
</PRE>
		<BR>
		
		DATATYPE FOR MIB VARIABLES are simple such as integer or octet string.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		OTHER OBJECTS
		<BR>
		The interesting thing with the object-oriented point of view is that almost
		everything can be considered as an object.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		ISO AND CCITT STRUCTURE OF INFORMATION
		<BR>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#iso" TARGET="glossary">ISO</A>
		and
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#ccitt" TARGET="glossary">CCITT</A>
		use the idea of structuring information into global naming tree
		and assigning an identifier to each objects.

		ADMINISTRATIVE NODES IN THE ISO/CCITT TREE
		<BR>
		A node can be used as a register that indicates who is in charge of the objects
		under it. A node is defined in the tree for each administrative entity.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		THE SUBTREE UNDER INTERNET CONTROL
		<BR>
		Under
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#internet" TARGET="glossary">internet</A>
		there are 6 nodes. For this part about SNMP V.1 we are concerned
		with the mgmt, experimental and private  node. They are administrated by the
		Internet Assignment Numbers Authority.
		The mgmt (management) subtree is made of all accepted standard network
		management variables.
		Experimentation and research are under the experimental node.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		GROUPS IN MIB MODULE
		<BR>
		A
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#module" TARGET="glossary">module</A>
		is a publication made by experts defining MIB object for a particular
		area of technology.
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mibg" TARGET="glossary">Groups</A>
		are smaller units than large module. It is a group of objects. Useful
		groups can be implemented by a vendor for a product.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		VENDOR MIB DEFINITIONS
		<BR>
		The private subtree enables private organisations to enhance the usefulness of
		SNMP. Into its own part of the subtree, a vendor uses product identifiers an
		the MIB definition that are needed to manage its products. Product identifiers
		combined with the MIB-II system description variable allows a device to
		identify itself precisely.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		GLOBAL TREE TO ASSIGN IDENTIFIERS
		<BR>
		The objects are a leaf node in the global tree. Each of the node is assigned a
		label consisting of an integer and a quick description. The identifier of an
		object is a series of integer guiding through the tree from the root to the
		good leaf. This is called the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#oi" TARGET="glossary">OBJECT IDENTIFIER</A>
		.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		The text part of each node helps to recognise what the string of number stands
		for. This :
		<TT>
			iso_org_dod_internet_mgmt_mib-2_interfaces_ifTable_ifEntry_ifOperStatus
		</TT>
		is easier to understand than 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8 the same in the number format.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		<LI>
		OBJECT IDENTIFIER indicates the kind of object that we want to know things
		about. If the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#bridge" TARGET="glossary">bridge</A>
		or the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#router" TARGET="glossary">router</A>
		have more than one interface, we need to
		know the good one we are interested in.
		<BR>
		
		An instance identifier is used to indicate the precise value we want to see.
		The variable has the form OBJECT IDENTIFER.value_we_want.
		<BR>
		
		Using the preceding example we had 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8 thus to have the third
		interface (in that case it is an interface) we have 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.3.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The principle is that to form a variable name from OBJECT IDENTIFIER, we only
		have to add an index at the end that show the item we want to access.
		<BR>
		
		In the case an object defining one-and-only type of thing (e.g. description of
		a system, or its location). The variable is added a 0. The path is OBJECT
		IDENTIFIER , and to have the parameter we are asking for OBJECT IDENTIFIER .0.
