		At the begining in 1988, there was the need of an administration tool for
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#tcpip" TARGET="glossary">TCP/IP</A> network and most particularly for the <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#internet2" TARGET="glossary">Internet</A>.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The starting point had been given by the <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#iab" TARGET="glossary">IAB</A> with the publication of the <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rfc" TARGET="glossary">RFC</A>
		1052 in April 1988. This RFC is a requirement specification for the network
		management standard. It is entitled "IAB Recommendations for the Development of
		Internet Network Management Standards" and explain that the network management
		must :
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		Be as large as possible.
		<LI>
		Have the wider diversity of implementation as possible.
		<LI>
		Have the wider diversity of administration/management as possible.
		<LI>
		Cover as much protocol layer as possible.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		From that point things are going faster. An important part of the concept were
		already known by previous development around routers notably <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#sgmp" TARGET="glossary">SGMP</A> (Simple
		Gateway Monitoring Protocol).
		<BR>
		The following RFCs are the first documents dealing with SNMP published in 1988
		:
		<BR>
		<LI>
		RFC 1065 - Structure and Identification of Management Information for
		TCP/IP-based internets
		<LI>
		RFC 1066 - Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based
		internets
		<LI>
		RFC 1067 - A Simple Network Management Protocol
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		This type of publication "RFC" is a very important point that explain the fast
		development of the SNM Protocol.
		<BR>
		After a previous study, a RFC is proposed as a status of standard. Then it
		normally becomes a "Draft Standard" after a six month period.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		At this point, there must be then at least two implementation of the protocol.
		<BR>
		After a four month period, if the <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#iesg" TARGET="glossary">IESG</A> recommend it as a standard,
		then the IAB take the final decision to adopt the standard or not.

		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#iso" TARGET="glossary">ISO</A> and <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#iut" TARGET="glossary">ITU-T</A> ( International Telecommunication Union ) had in important
		influence on the SNMP with their will of convergence.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The IAB wished that transition from one to the other architectures was as easy
		as possible.
		Finally, the synchronisation between the two protocols had been very difficult
		and the convergence plan based over <A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#cmot" TARGET="glossary">CMOT</A> (allowing TCP/IP management with
		CMIS/<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#cmip" TARGET="glossary">CMIP</A>) has been dropped off and thus SNMP moves forward .
		<BR>
		
		Each protocol followed then his own development. The SNMP conception goes
		faster and the RFC had been re-write with new functions. The 1.0 version was
		reached in May 1991 with the followings RFC :
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		RFC 1155 -
		<BR>
		Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based
		Internets Structure and Identification of Management Information Guidelines for
		Object Names
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Describe how management information has been structured into a global tree.
		<LI>
		Lays down some restrictions to keep the protocol simplicity.
		<LI>
		Introduce the rules for assigning names to objects.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		RFC 1212 -
		<BR>
		Concise <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A> Definitions
		<BR>
		Complete the RFC 1515 with technical definitions.
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Improves on the definition techniques defined in RFC 1155.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		RFC 1213 -
		<BR>
		Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets:
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib2" TARGET="glossary">MIB-II</A>
		<BR>
		<LI>
		This memo defines the second version of the Management Information Base
		(MIB-II) to use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
		<LI>
		A listing of over 100 vars. Needed to keep the settings, the status and the
		statistics of the operating systems of the network.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		RFC 1157
		<BR>
		<LI>
		A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
		<LI>
		Define the messages that can be exchanged between the management station and
		the managed entity to read or update values.
		<LI>
		Define the alarm messages (<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#trap" TARGET="glossary">TRAP</A>) send by the system in stress status.
		<LI>
		Define the message format and details if the communication protocol.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Different workgroup contribute to the development and the opening of the
		protocol by building MIBs for all types of network equipment (<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#bridge" TARGET="glossary">Bridge</A>, <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#router" TARGET="glossary">Router</A>,
		Hub, ASCII monitors, <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#wan" TARGET="glossary">WAN</A> interface, DS1, DS3, <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#x25" TARGET="glossary">X25</A>, Frame Relay, Ethernet, <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#tr" TARGET="glossary">Token
		Ring</A>, <A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#fddi" TARGET="glossary">FDDI</A>...) and also vendors protocols.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		In November 1991 are published requirement for the integration of probes. This
		probe watch, do survey and capture passively the traffic on a segment of the LAN
		for a later analysis. It maintains statistics of the traffic,
		breakdown caused by protocol, source, destination and other criteria. A network
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#manager" TARGET="glossary">manager</A> with the <A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#monitor" TARGET="glossary">monitor</A> is able to set threshold in monitor and set the
		management station that must receive the alert messages.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		April 1993, <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#v2" TARGET="glossary">SNMP V2</A> becomes a standard. It offers new features that complete a
		few the lack of the previous version such as security and authentication. This
		version is criticised because it introduce complexity and a failure of
		compatibility with V1.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Finally in 1997, a merging group is created. Its main topic : create <A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#v3" TARGET="glossary">SNMP V3</A>.
		There is also work in order to adapt multimedia protocol to network management,
		development around Java or new architectures and protocols (HMMP : Hypermedia
		Management Protocol).
