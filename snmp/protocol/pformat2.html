		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#getreq" TARGET="glossary">Get-request</A>
		<BR>
		is used to request the values of one or more MIB variables.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#getnreq" TARGET="glossary">Get-next-request</A>
		<BR>
		is used to read the values of variables in the MIB but sequentially. It is
		often used to read though a table of values. After a first read with the
		get-request, get-next-request are used to read through the remaining rows.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#setreq" TARGET="glossary">Set-request</A>
		<BR>
		is used to update one of the MIB values.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#getrep" TARGET="glossary">Get-response</A>
		<BR>
		is returned as an answer to a get-request, a get-next-request or set-request
		message.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#trap" TARGET="glossary">Trap</A>

		is used to support significant events (e.g. a cold or a warm restart or a link
		that has gone down).

		A get-request or set-request can read or write a single or several items. An
		item is a simple variable (example : system name). We can also say that SNMP
		recognises that variables are leaves at the bottom of the naming tree.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The problem is that a
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#manager" TARGET="glossary">manager</A>
		do not know all the variables. Even when a new
		implementation replace an old one, he do not know all the variable. The
		get-next-request is helpful then. The manager is able to walk through the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A>
		using the get-next-request command. Thus, the manager know all the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#oi" TARGET="glossary">OBJECT IDENTIFIER</A>
		. When MIB variable are added, the old meanings of the MIB do not
		change and there are new values in the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#table" TARGET="glossary">table</A>
		.

			Get-request and get-response Message Formats
			
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The fields contained in those messages are the following one :
		<BR>
		<LI>
		Version : version of SNMP (0 is for version 1)
		<LI>
		Community : password used to control access to node information. It does not
		provide a lot of protection against spying on the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#lan" TARGET="glossary">LAN</A>
		.
		<LI>
		Command : one of the five message type.
		<LI>
		Request ID : used to correlate the request and its answer. Because a station
		can shoot hundreds of request at the same time.
		<LI>
		Error status : in response, it is used to indicate if the request was
		successful or not.
		<LI>
		Error index : in case of error indicates which variable in the request caused
		problem.
		<LI>
		A list of pairing
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#oi" TARGET="glossary">OBJECT IDENTIFIER</A>
		(string of integer) and variable value
		of the parameter pointed by the OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The  get-request and the get-response contain the same fields. So it is easy
		for an
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#agent" TARGET="glossary">agent</A>
		to build an answer to a request just by filling the holes in the
		get-request. Thus, get-request contains fields set a 0 or NULL values.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		A get-request can be sent for multiple variables. Then it contains the list of
		the variables we want to be retrieved. The get-response  fills each value from
		each variable of the list.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The problem with SNMP version 1, is that if for one of the requested variable,
		the agent is unable to provide a value, the whole get-request will fail. Even
		if it is one out of the ten variables we wanted to retrieve.
		<BR>
		The maximal number of value to retrieve is limited by the maximum message size
		handle by the manager and the agent. This maximum size is expected to be over
		484 bytes in SNMP standards.
		<BR>
		<BR>

			Get-next-request
			
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The get-next-request, in its simplest use, is for a walk through a
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#table" TARGET="glossary">table</A>
		one row
		at a time.
		<BR>
		The get-next-request have the same overall format as get-request and
		get-response. The Command type identifies which is which.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		Different sets of variables are appropriate for bridges, routers and hosts. The
		variables in a pair of routers may be different because the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#interf" TARGET="glossary">interface</A>
		can be
		different in the two devices (e.g. one is Ethernet and
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#fddi" TARGET="glossary">FDDI</A>
		LANs, the other
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#tr" TARGET="glossary">Token-Rings</A>
		and T1 lines).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		To know what variables are stored at a node, we can manage the node by manually
		creating a master configuration database in a management station. We could,
		in this database, record the type of node and the categories of MIB variables
		supported at the node.
		<BR>
		In this case we would have to maintain the database by hand, each time by adding
		and deleting the entries each time the configuration changed.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The other way to know the stored variable at the node is to implement a
		management application that will dynamically discovers nodes of the network and
		ask the node what are the variables and what they support. This second method
		is the way that good management station operates. The station can operate this
		way because of the get-next-request operator.

			The Communities
			
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		The access to an agent is restricted by the community. The
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#manager" TARGET="glossary">manager</A>
		sending a
		message to the agent gives its community. The community defines what level of
		access the manager have. Agents have to be configured in order to know one or
		more community, and which right (level of access) each community owns.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		There is also community right for traps. The agent needs to know where to send
		its traps. It is also configurable.
		<BR>
