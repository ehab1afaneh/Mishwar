		The main problems of the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#snmp" TARGET="glossary">version 1</A>
		are the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#authen" TARGET="glossary">authentication</A>
		of the message
		source, protecting these message from disclosure and placing access controls
		on
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A>
		database. Those problems are solved in
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#v2" TARGET="glossary">SNPM v2</A>
		, they
		required significant changes to the format of SNMP
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#pdu" TARGET="glossary">PDUs</A>
		.
		<BR>
		Two new protocol operations have been added. One supports efficient transfer of
		large amount of MIB data, the other enables a
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#manager" TARGET="glossary">manager</A>
		to inform another manager
		of significant events.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		In SNMPv2, if a multiple requested value, in a
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#getreq" TARGET="glossary">get-request</A>
		, one is not valid
		or does not exist, there will be answers for the other request that have been
		well dealt.
		<BR>
		Whereas for version 1, no response at all was given, only the error message.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		In version 1,
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#trap" TARGET="glossary">traps</A>
		had a different format than all of the other PDUs.
		Version2 simplify traps by giving them the same format as the get and set
		PDUs.

		It enables a manager to send some information to another manager.  This message
		type helps organisation that needs a hierarchy of network management stations.
		A manager that sends an inform-request will receive the echo of its message as
		proof of delivery.

		As message sizes are limited by the local capabilities of each agent, if too
		much data are asked in an ordinary get-request you receive a message "too big"
		error message without data.
		<BR>
		The get bulk request allows you to retrieve a lot of information, then you will
		receive as much data as it is possible in your response message.
		This request can retrieve stand alone scalar variables and&nbsp;/&nbsp;or
		columns from a table.

		SNMP and
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#agent" TARGET="glossary">Agent</A>
		communicate by means of messages transmitted usually in
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#udp" TARGET="glossary">UDP</A>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#datagram" TARGET="glossary">datagrams</A>
		. The good state of all the network stands on this messages. And here,
		security is very important.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		We need to be sure of the message source and about its contents.
		We need to be protected against eavesdroppers and we also need to
		restrict MIB databases to some applications.
		Those are all security, authentication and control problems
		(for this point it is made by access control lists).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		SNMP V2 security framework deals with the problem of the authentication of the
		message sender,  its contents and the eavesdropper problems. SNMPv2 supports
		the 		use of authentication protocol to identify the sources
		reliability and to prevent message modification.
		<BR>
		SNMPv2 also supports the use of encryption to keep messages
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#privacy" TARGET="glossary">privacy</A>
		.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		The recommended authentication procedure is the Digest Authentication Protocol.
		<BR>
		This protocol is based on the message-digest to authenticate message source and
		prevent message tampering.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<I>
			Message-digest :
		</I>
		
		<BR>
		It is a message treated like a string of 32-bit numbers. It is just a
		mathematical calculation performed on these numbers and included with the
		message. The message-digest protocol chops messages into bits, mixes it up
		with a secret ingredient and selects a few bits here and there to assemble
		into its result. The result is sent to the partner with the original message.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The authentication only proves that the message is genuine, it does not prevent
		an eavesdropper from reading the message.
		<BR>
		Privacy is kept by advancing to a higher level of protection by encrypting
		messages. SNMPv2 is structured so that any privacy protocol can be dropped in
		and used.
		<BR>
		The current protocol is a symetric encryption using the Data Encryption
		Standard. The same key is used to encrypt message and to decrypt it.

		<BR>
		<BR>
		SNMP Version 1 was easy to implement and maintain. Now in version 2, the
		introduction of authentication and privacy helps to keep the network safe.
		<BR>
		But, on the other, hand the implementation is much larger and more complex. The
		important information have to be protected and kept in the device if a crash
		comes, those information are kept in a non volatile memory.
		<BR>
		The SNMPv2 gives many solutions against piracy but an attacker can still do many
		annoying things.
