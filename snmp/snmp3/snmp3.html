		The third version of the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#v3" TARGET="glossary">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)</A>
		was
		published as proposed standards in
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rfc" TARGET="glossary">RFCs</A>
		2271 to 2275 in January 1998. This
		version is build upon the two first versions of
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#snmp" TARGET="glossary">SNMP</A>
		and so it reuse the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#v2" TARGET="glossary">SNMPv2</A>
		standards documents (RFC 1902 to RFC 1908).
		<BR>
		SNMP v3 Framework augments the original SNMP and the SNMPv2 specifications
		with additional security and administration capabilities.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The new features of SNMPv3 include:
		<UL>
			<I>
				Security
			</I>
			<UL>
				<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#authen" TARGET="glossary">authentication</A>
				and
				<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#privacy" TARGET="glossary">privacy</A>
				<BR>
				authorisation and
				<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#accessc" TARGET="glossary">access control</A>

			<I>
				Administrative Framework

			<BR>
			<UL>
				naming of entities
				<BR>
				people and policies

		<BR>
		The SNMPv3 document series defined by the SNMPv3 Working Group consists of five
		documents at this time (RFC 2271 to RFC 2275).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			Architecture&nbsp;/&nbsp;Security and Administration
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		It is the purpose of the SNMPv3 Architecture document, RFC 2271, to define an
		architecture for defining SNMP Management Frameworks. It defines a number of
		terms and clarifies and extends the naming of
		<UL>
			<LI>
			engines and applications
			<BR>
			<LI>
			entities (service providers such as the engines in agents and managers)
			<BR>
			<LI>
			identities (service users)
			<BR>
			<LI>
			management information, including support for multiple logical contexts.
		</UL>
		
		
		The document contains a small
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A>
		module which is implemented by all
		authoritative SNMPv3 protocol engines. An authoritative engine is the receiver
		of a message such as a get or set, or the sender if the message does not
		require a response.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			Message Processing and Dispatching
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		The Message Processing and Dispatching for the SNMP, proposed in RFC 2272,
		defines the procedures for dispatching multiple versions of SNMP messages to
		the proper SNMP Message Processing Models. It also provides the way to dispatch
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#pdu" TARGET="glossary">PDUs</A>
		to SNMP applications. Finally, this document describes one Message
		Processing Model - the SNMPv3 Message Processing Model.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		An SNMPv3 protocol engine MUST support at least one Message Processing Model
		and MAY support more than one. For example, in a multilingual system which
		provides simultaneous support of SNMPv3 and SNMPv1 and/or SNMPv2.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			SNMPv3 Applications
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Five types of application which can be associated with an SNMP engine are
		described in RFC 2273. These applications are :
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Command Generators
			<LI>
			Command Responders
			<LI>
			Notification Originators
			<LI>
			Notification Receivers
			<LI>
			Proxy Forwarders.
		</UL>
		
		
		The document also defines MIB modules for specifying targets of management
		operations, for notification filtering, and for proxy forwarding.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			User-based Security Model (USM)
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		It was proposed in RFC 2274 and it describes the User-based Security Model for
		SNMPv3. It defines the Elements of Procedure for providing SNMP message-level
		security. The USM protects the user against four threats, which are :
		<UL>
			<LI>
			modification of information
			<LI>
			masquerade
			<LI>
			message stream modification
			<LI>
			disclosure (optionally)
		</UL>
		
		The USM uses MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm) and the Secure Hash Algorithm 		to
		provide data integrity, to directly protect against data modification attacks,
		to
		indirectly provide data origin authentication, and to defend against masquerade
		attacks. It also uses Data Encryption Standard (DES) to protect against
		disclosure.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The document also includes a MIB for remotely monitoring and managing the
		configuration parameters for the USM.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			View-based Access Control Model (VACM)
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		It was proposed in RFC 2275 and it describes the View-based Access Control
		Model for SNMPv3. It defines the Elements of Procedure for controlling access
		to management information.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The VACM can simultaneously be associated in a single engine implementation
		with multiple Message Processing Models and multiple Security Models.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		The document also includes a MIB for remotely managing the configuration
		parameters for the View-based Access Control Model.
