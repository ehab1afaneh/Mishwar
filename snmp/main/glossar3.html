		<P>
		<B>
			<A NAME="router">Router</A>
		</B>
		- Network layer device that uses one or more metrics to determine the optimal
		path along which network traffic should be forwarded. Routers forward packets
		from one network to another based on network layer information. It is
		occasionally called a gateway.
		<P>
		<P>
		<B>
			<A NAME="rt">Routing</A>
			Tables
		</B>
		- Table stored in a router or some other internetworking device that keeps
		track of routes to particular network destinations and, in some cases, metrics
