		It was in 1991, the Remote Network Monitoring
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A>
		was published in
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rfc" TARGET="glossary">RFC 1271</A>
		,
		known as "RMON MIB". This contains the tools needed by a network management
		station to configure and control a
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#monitor" TARGET="glossary">monitor</A>
		, read out data and reports, and
		receive
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#alarm" TARGET="glossary">alarms</A>
		.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		There are rules to
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rmon" TARGET="glossary">RMON</A>
		in order to maintain the system in order to run. Those
		rules give to different operators many rights. There are systems
		that can give rights to one operator, or that can share them between different
		users
		(example one manage one
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#interf" TARGET="glossary">interface</A>
		and another one, the other interface of the
		device). It depends on choices made by vendors. Users have to select their own
		administrative model.
		<BR>
		
		The mechanism to manage the device is the following one : the operator is
		identified by a variable, which is issued to implement the desired
		administrative model. Once control table is complete (index assigned and has
		valid status), the monitor starts the job required by the entry.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		RFC 1271 Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base provides many
		features for monitoring and a large number of general variables.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		Monitor operator can configure the monitor to show data in the most
		significant way for the user. The operator sets the exact parameters he wants :
		<BR>
		How long should the monitor keep the data, how long is a survey...
		<BR>
		Two operators can ask a monitor a different survey type for the same
		parameter&nbsp;; if 		the monitor can hold it, it will be done.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		To make the difference between several
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#manager" TARGET="glossary">manager's</A>
		requests, there are two
		control table variables. One identifies who wrote the request and the
		other indicates the current status of the control table entry.
		<BR>
		These variables are labelled OwnerString, it contains information about the
		owner of the entry :
		<BR>
		<LI>
		the administrative name
		<LI>
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#ip" TARGET="glossary">IP</A>
		address
		<LI>
		management station name
		<LI>
		operator’s name
		<LI>
		location or phone number
		<BR>
		
		
		and EntryStatus is an integer : valid(1), createRequest(2), underCreation(3),
		invalid(4)). It starts with a set that create the request in the control table :
		<BR>
		<LI>
		the request is initialised and the entry becomes valid
		<LI>
		the operator create the request
		<LI>
		the monitor gather information
		<LI>
		the operator sets the invalid condition to end the task
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		There is a large number of groups in the RMON MIB. The order hides the close
		relationship between groups. They are the following one  :
		<BR>
		<B>
			<LI>
			<A HREF="mostati1.html">statistics (1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1)</A>
			<LI>
			<A HREF="mohisto2.html">history (1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2)</A>
			<LI>
			<A HREF="mohost3.html">host (1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4)</A>
			<LI>
			<A HREF="mohostn4.html">hostTopN (1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5)</A>
			<LI>
			<A HREF="momatri5.html">matrix (1.3.6.1.2.1.16.6)</A>
		</B>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		
		<!-- Transition for the following Groups. -->
		The following groups are working together. They work as a whole, as a
		diagnostic team. They are used in case of network problems, when a particular
		kind of traffic needs to be watched precisely. The event group, packet group
		and filter group are linked to give a fine tuned of diagnostic tools.

			Configuration, Control, and Data Tables
		</FONT>
		<BR>

		A monitor is very powerful and can do a lot, but you have to know how to ask him
		in order to get what you want. Thus, the configuration for this type of device
		is very
		important. This MIB contains a lot of configuration parameters.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		A control table configures the information to be monitored, for example there is
		the time interval for capture that must be set with the amount of data to keep
		and record. A separate data table holds the information that are gathered. One
		control entry is linked to the data that is gathered.
