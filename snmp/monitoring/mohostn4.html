		This group allows to know the busiest station on the network and which is really
		busy. The hostTopN group provides frameworks to configure what we want the
		report to tell us. The operator can choose the criteria which will give him the
		hosts matching with the parameters. These parameters are the following
		ones :
		<BR>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			Incoming packets
			<LI>
			Outgoing packets
			<LI>
			Incoming octets
			<LI>
			Outgoing octets
			<LI>
			Outgoing errors
			<LI>
			Outgoing broadcast packets
			<LI>
			Outgoing multicast packet.
		</OL>
		
		The top N (N is the number of stations you want in your result table) report is
		extracted then, written in the hostTopNControlTable .
		<BR>
		This includes :
		<BR>
		<LI>
		the maximum number of hosts you want to track.
		<LI>
		one of the 7 preceding parameters statistics.
		<LI>
		the time the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#monitor" TARGET="glossary">monitor</A>
		started.
		<LI>
		The duration of the reporting interval.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Two copies of the time interval are created. One of them is counted down
		(hostTopNTimeRemaining) until it reaches 0. Thus, it can not be set to 0. And
		the interval setting is copied into the hostTopNDuration variable.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		The duration variable is immovable. But the hostTopNTimeRemaining variable will
		decrease second by second until it reaches 0, then the sampling results are
		written in the  Host Top N table.
		<BR>
		
		The result of the counts configured are stored in the HostTopN table. Hosts
		that have the largest charge of the selected parameters are listed (sorted
		descending). At each report, hosts are indexed by their Top N order.
