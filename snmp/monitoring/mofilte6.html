		With this group, the 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#monitor" TARGET="glossary">monitor</A>
		 is able to let us pick the traffic we want to
		watch. The traffic is watched and filtered by a series of filter tests. This
		allows to extract the logical stream of data (called channel) we want. A filter
		tests two things :
		<BR>
		<DD>
		<LI TYPE="CIRCLE">
		Presence or not of data patterns.
		<DD>
		<LI TYPE="CIRCLE">
		Presence or not of particular errors.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		To be accepted by the filter, traffic must pass the data pattern-matching test
		and the status-check error.
		<BR>
		
		<LI TYPE="DISC">
		To define a Pattern Matching filter we have to set :
		<BR>
		
		<DD>
		<LI TYPE="CIRCLE">
		an offset from the begining of a packet. The pattern checking will start here.
		<BR>
		
		<DD>
		<LI TYPE="CIRCLE">
		the string of octets that forms the data pattern to be matched.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI TYPE="DISC">
		Error-Checking Filter
		<BR>
		This criteria let us choose traffic with or without selected errors. The result
		of the error checking is stored in the packet status variable. The monitor
		check each 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#packet" TARGET="glossary">packet</A>
		 for errors and compute its packet status.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		To do the comparison, a mask is defined. The comparison is made only for the
		packet status bits that corresponds to mask bits with value 1. Another mask
		gives
		the bits that we want to match. A channel is defined with one or more filters.
		This allows to complicate a lot the conditions.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI  TYPE="DISC">
		Filter Table
		<BR>
		Each entry in this table defines a filter. Each filter provides a set of
		criteria in order to screen every packets and decides whether it belongs to a
		logical channel or not.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI>
		Channel Table
		<BR>
		Channels are used to define a stream of packets that will be captured. Also,
		when we search for rare but important patterns, we want to generate an event
		whenever a packet is selected for the channel.
		<BR>
		
		The Channel table contains the control parameters needed to complete the
		description of a channel. We have to identify the interface that will be
		watched. A control variable is used to turn a channel on or off.
