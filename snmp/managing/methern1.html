		Ethernet works by connecting an almost unlimited number of devices to the same
		coaxial cable. A station is connected to an
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#aui" TARGET="glossary">Attachment Unit Interface (AUI)</A>
		cable. This cable connects to a transceiver that clamps onto the coaxial cable
		(by "vampire" Tap).
		<BR>
		The most popular physical layout today is the use of a twisted pair cable to
		connect
		stations to a hub . Multiple hubs are connected by a high-quality grade of
		shielded twisted pair or by fiber-optic cable.
		<BR>
		The common Ethernet transmission speed is 10 Megabits per second (Mbps).

		A station can transmit whether the cable is not in use. The frame header
		contains the physical address of the destination station. All of the stations
		on the LAN hear the frame, but only the destination station accepts it.
		<BR>
		This figure is based on a rule called
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#csma" TARGET="glossary">Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)</A>
		. If two or more stations start transmitting at the same
		time, a collision occurs. Both senders then wait a random amount of time before
		transmitting again.

			<LI>
			A station has to respect a minimum time between two transmissions to give the
			receiver time to finish processing one
			<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#frame" TARGET="glossary">frame</A>
			before having to receive another.
			This time is 9.6 micro-seconds.
			<LI>
			Frames must be at least 64 octets long so that all the stations can hear if
			there is a collision.
			<LI>
			The maximum frame size is 1518 octets.

			Collision Histogram Table
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		This table contains the information needed to build a collision histogram. When
		a station intents to send a frame, there can be one or more collisions before it
		succeeds or gives up. For example, in the histogram below we can see that the
		first block of rectangles shows that, within the measurement period, there were
		eight frames that collided on the first try, but were transmitted on the second
		try. There were also, six frames that collided on both the first and the second
		tries, but then were transmitted without a problem.

		The Ethernet MIB defines a test that can be applied to coaxial cable
		implementations. This test called Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) test is used
		to check the approximate distance to an Ethernet coaxial cable default. The test
		result is defined as the time interval between the start of the test
		transmission and subsequent detection of a collision or "absence" of carrier.
		<BR>
		A network
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#manager" TARGET="glossary">manager</A>
		can start, stop and get results of the test (in
		100-nanosecond units) with the ifExtension group variables (1.3.6.1.2.1.12).
