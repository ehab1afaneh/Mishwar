		The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) has been created in 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rfc" TARGET="glossary">RFC</A>
		 1548 in order to
		carry all of the protocol traffic between two locations onto a single
		long-distance line.
		<BR>
		PPP is considered as an 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#interf" TARGET="glossary">interface</A>
		, and PPP entities will be listed in the
		interfaces table. However, PPP will usually be layered on top of another,
		lower-level interface, such as an RS-232.

		There are several PPP Protocols :
		<UL>
			<LI>
			A PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) used to negotiate link options and open a
			link. LCP negotiations can compress the 
			<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#frame" TARGET="glossary">frame</A>
			 format, adjust limits on frame
			sizes, choose an 
			<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#authen" TARGET="glossary">Authentication</A>
			 protocol, and initiate link monitoring.
			
			<LI>
			Separate Network Control Protocols (NCPs) used to negotiate options for the
			different types of traffic the PPP will carry.
			
			<LI>
			An optional Link Quality Monitoring Protocol used to enable each partner to
			find out the rate of its successfully transmitted data.

		The PPP 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mib" TARGET="glossary">MIB</A>
		 is made up of several groups, defined in different RFC documents.
		We will introduce the following groups :
		<BR>
		<LI>
		The 
		<A HREF="#link"><B> PPP Link Group</B></A>
		 is made up of a Link Status Table and a Link Configuration
		Table.
		<LI>
		The 
		<A HREF="#lqr"><B> PPP Link Quality Report (LQR) Group</B></A>
		 is made up of a table of parameters and
		statistics and a configuration table.
		<LI>
		The PPP Link Quality Report (LQR) Extensions Group holds the most recently
		received LQR 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#packet" TARGET="glossary">packet</A>
		.
		<LI>
		The 
		<A HREF="#security"><B> PPP Security Table</B></A>
		 is made up of configuration and control variables that
		relate to PPP security.
		<LI>
		The 
		<A HREF="#ip"><B> PPP IP Group</B></A>
		 is made up of configuration, status, and control variables
		that relate to running 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#ip" TARGET="glossary">IP</A>
		 over PPP.
		<LI>
		The 
		<A HREF="#bridge"><B> PPP Bridge Group</B></A>
		 is made up of configuration, status, and control variables
		that relate to 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#bridge" TARGET="glossary">bridging</A>
		 over PPP.
		
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			<A NAME="link">The</A>
			 PPP Link Group
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The PPP Link Group includes the Link Status Table and the Link Configuration
		Table.
		<BR>
		The Link Status Table records configuration choices that have been established
		for open links and also includes some error counts. The Link Configuration
		Table contains preconfigured parameter choices desired by the local end.
		<BR>
		During the link configuration dialogue, parameters from the table are proposed
		by one of the PPP link end. The other end can selectively reject any parameter
		that it cannot support. Then, the local end will have to modify its request
		until it is acceptable by the other side (or else abort the link).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			<A NAME="lqr">The PPP Link Quality Report</A>
			 (LQR) Group
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		One, or both ends of a PPP link can choose to monitor their link. So, they can
		ask a partner to transmit quality report at regular intervals via the PPP Link
		Quality Report Protocol (LQR).
		<BR>
		The LQR Table contains information about the present status of Link Quality
		Reporting. It indicates whether the link is currently good and records the
		local end remote timers that determine how often reports are sent.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		A Link Quality Report contains cumulative counts of :
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Number of packets and octets that have been sent
			<LI>
			Number of received packets
			<LI>
			Number of incoming error packets, and packets discarded
			<LI>
			Number of good octets that have been received
		</UL>
		
		The three first values listed above are obtained from variables already defined
		in the interfaces MIB. For this reason, there is only two counters in the LQR
		Table : the total number of Link Quality Reports that have been sent and
		received.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		The PPP LQR Configuration Table contains variables that records the monitoring
		configuration for a link.
		The PPP LQR Extensions Table contains a variable that holds the most recently
		received LQR packet. This variable is used to see whether a link is "good" or
		"bad".
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			<A NAME="security">The PPP Security</A>
			 Table
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		The PPP Security Table configures the protocols that will be proposed during
		link negotiation and the order of preference in which they will be proposed.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			<A NAME="ip">The PPP IP</A>
			 Group
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		
		The next step, after the establishment of the link and after any necessary
		authentication, is the negotiation of the Network Control Protocols (NCP) for
		the upper layer (layer 3) traffic that will be carried on the link. The PPP IP
		Table reports IP NCP status information for a device’s PPP links. It indicates
		whether PPP negotiation is completed and so has reached an opened state, and
		whether TCP/IP compression is used when sending. The PPP IP Configuration Table
		indicates whether TCP/IP compression should be negotiated.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
			<A NAME="bridge">The PPP Bridge</A>
			 Group
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		To use bridging across the PPP link, the Bridge Network Control Protocol is
		used to initialise and terminate the link.
		<BR>
		The PPP Bridge Table contains the NCP status information necessary to a
		device’s PPP link. It indicates whether the Bridge NCP has reached an opened
		state, reports the eventually use of compression, and the use of a 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#lan" TARGET="glossary">LAN</A>
		identification field in packets. The PPP Bridge Configuration Table contains
		configuration information for PPP bridging.
		<BR>
		The PPP Bridge Media Table records the types of MAC frames that can be sent or
		received across each of the system’s interfaces. The PPP Bridge Media
		Configuration Table contains configuration information used to negotiate the
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#mac" TARGET="glossary">MAC</A>
		 types to be sent or received.
