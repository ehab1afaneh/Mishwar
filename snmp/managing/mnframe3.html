		Created in 1990, Frame Relay 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#interf" TARGET="glossary">interface</A>
		 has points in common with the 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#x25" TARGET="glossary">X25</A>
		standard interface. Like X25, a single interface is used to access multiple
		destinations, and like X25, 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#vc" TARGET="glossary">virtual circuits</A>
		 are used to exchange information
		between devices. On the other hand, Frame Relay operates at the physical and
		data link layers only in order to provide best frame delivery service.

			Virtual Circuits
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) are connecting a frame relay user’s site to
		selected remote sites. A PVC always links the same pair of sites.
		<BR>
		The figure below shows how a site A can be connected to sites B, C or D by
		means of virtual circuits. Outgoing 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#frame" TARGET="glossary">frames</A>
		 from site A to any other site pass
		through a point-to-point link joining the site A to the network. Similarly,
		incoming frames are passed to site A across the point-to-point link.

			The Data Link Connection Identifier
		</FONT>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Each incoming and outgoing frame contains a number (
		<A HREF="../main/glossar1.html#dlci" TARGET="glossary">the Data Link Connection Identifier or DLCI</A>
		) that identifies its virtual circuit. The DLCI number is not
		the same along the network even if the virtual circuit is the same. That means
		that a virtual circuit identified by the number 37 at site A might appear as
		circuit number 17 at site B. It is the network that have to fill in a DLCI that
		means something to site A before passing the frame down the link to site A. The
		figure below shows an example of how local DLCIs can be used to identify
		virtual circuits between sites A, B, C and D.

		<A HREF="../main/glossar3.html#rfc" TARGET="glossary">RFC</A>

			 Connection Management Table

		The device user periodically polls the network by sending a "keepalive" status
		inquiry, it also requests a full status report at regular intervals.
		<BR>
		The Data Link Connection Management Table contains configuration parameters
		that include the base polling intervals and the number of intervals between
		status requests.
		<BR>
		Other parameters indicate the maximum number of virtual circuits that can be
		opened and whether multicasting is support. For example, a multicast to all
		circuits partner asking for their 
		<A HREF="../main/glossar2.html#ip" TARGET="glossary">IP</A>
		 addresses can be used to build an Address
		Resolution Table.

		<BR>

		The Frame Relay Circuit Table contains each interface/DLCI combination and an
		entry for each circuit. It is explained because one frame relay interface can
		support multiple virtual circuits, each identified by a DLCI, and because a
		device can support several frame relay interfaces.
		<BR>
		An entry records the Circuit Throughput, Committed Burst, and Excess burst. It
		also contains counts of incoming and outgoing traffic, and indicates the
		frequency of incoming and outgoing congestion for each circuit. All the
		statistical counts for a virtual circuit are measured from the time that the
		virtual circuit was created.

		The Frame Relay Error Table records the most recent errors for each interface.
		Each error is stored as a bad data frame or as a bad management frame and the
		time at which the error was detected is also recorded.
